Apparently AI is suddenly all the rage however the 2019 edition celebrates 16 years of ZingMagic bringing you the best in AI based board, card and puzzle games. So, yep we mastered AI along time ago!\r\n\r\nRegardless of your playing level, ZingMagic's multi award winning Chess is a fun, stimulating and challenging game for beginners and champions alike.\r\n\r\nChess is a two player game with a colourful history which can be traced back to its Indian ancestor, Chaturanga. In 1291 the Archbishop of Canterbury in England threatened clergy who continued playing Chess with a diet of bread and water.  \r\nThe game has flourished over the years and is now one of the most popular board games in the world, requiring thought, skill and strategy to become successful.\r\n\r\nThe object of Chess is to capture the opponent's King.  To capture the King you must place it in check.  If the King cannot escape by itself, or with the help of its army, it is in checkmate and the King is captured.\r\n \r\nZingMagic’s multi award winning Chess application supports over 20 levels of play allowing you to play moves or games against the clock or relax and play at your own pace.

We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N6P9T9JJCJM","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"WORLDS Builder: Farm & Craft","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17176.14014618197645784.3003ef2e-eb8e-4651-98c0-ce41f64ae0d1.0106fa04-ca72-4138-816d-cf029a5e707e","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#5ba2be","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6710.14014618197645784.3003ef2e-eb8e-4651-98c0-ce41f64ae0d1.423c3cc6-58c1-426f-b98b-9229898c1687","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#5ba2be","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58567.14014618197645784.3003ef2e-eb8e-4651-98c0-ce41f64ae0d1.dbf2d7ce-260e-4c04-9aa3-829d8ec34610","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#5ba2be","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50511.14014618197645784.3003ef2e-eb8e-4651-98c0-ce41f64ae0d1.7f895c9c-d1f6-4011-a49d-8d5c69b0b7fa","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#5ba2be","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44575.14014618197645784.50ccc3b5-7ef1-42f8-a63d-5b551c8c2a80.328486d5-82fe-424e-9596-d84145a9d4d7","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#5ba2be","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34763.14014618197645784.3003ef2e-eb8e-4651-98c0-ce41f64ae0d1.a80ab601-c26f-4fed-9302-2fe403ee40fe","Height":188,"Width":388,"BackgroundColor":"#5ba2be","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2681.14014618197645784.50ccc3b5-7ef1-42f8-a63d-5b551c8c2a80.b0f490cb-a0f7-4edc-bb43-a7b8679f2c7f","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18854.14014618197645784.50ccc3b5-7ef1-42f8-a63d-5b551c8c2a80.7eca837f-c7a5-40b0-a100-b789ac48611c","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["JoyBitsLtd.547286251ADD1_2687mb06qk6xe"],"ContentIds":["1b7a7504-7027-e016-8fcd-de85454d2d82","6d692e92-89c5-9b00-44a1-142d35a5a691"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"© WORLDS Builder - from creators of Doodle GOD, Doodle Devil and Doodle Mafia\r\n\r\nCommand the powerful forces of nature to bring the world of your vision into life! \r\nCreate earth and divide it from water, erect mountains and fire up volcanoes; spread boundless sands, lush forests and golden fields all over your land.

Like a tower of meat and bones.\r\n\r\nWe've spent the last few years spinning the TD genre into something so wild and dangerous, we’re not even sure if the world is ready for it. But hey, it’s your game now, you tell us — we’re in it for the long haul.\r\n\r\nA word of warning, though:\r\nThis game is hardcore. If you’re into tickling digital kittens, stick to playing The Tribez (Get good vibes — play The Tribez!©).\r\nThis game will make you miss your stop during your daily commute!\r\nThis game will make you cry tears of joy in unexpected places.\r\n\r\nThe Survival Arena focuses on these key factors: it’s not about hiring the best troops or winning PvP battles, it’s about prevailing against all odds! Build mighty towers, upgrade them, and try to hold off hordes of incoming enemies!\r\nYou know that feeling when it seems like Friday, but it's actually Thursday? Survival Arena is kind of like that. It’s so addicting that when you finally put down the game, you'll realize you’re 93 years old with 20 grandchildren.

To have some fun with all the treasures in his late years, he decided to throw the biggest challenge across the floating isles — The Survival Arena Tournament.\r\n\r\nAny Captain brave enough can venture into the eye of the storm, and if fortune turns its favorable side, they will find the arena. Thousands have tried to beat the challenges and survive, but none could beat the records.

variation of popular card game \"Liverpool Rummy\", similar to \"Contract Rummy\" or \"Shanghai Rummy\", with special cards and simplified rules.\r\nThe objective of the game is to be the first player to complete all 10 game phases with defined card sets. However, beware: it's not easy to win on the highest difficulty level!\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Randomly generated or predefined phase goals\r\n- Configurable number of players: 2-4\r\n- Configurable game difficulty: 1-10\r\n- Configurable game speed\r\n- Undo function\r\n- Clear UI design: NO music, NO irritating avatars!\r\n- No online login required\r\n\r\nObject:\r\nTo be the first player to complete all phases/contracts. In case of a tie, the player with the lowest score is the winner. A Joker card '*' may be used to replace a number card and can also be used as any color to complete any phase.\r\nSkip cards have only one purpose: to make another player lose their turn. To use it, give the card to the player you want to lose their turn.  \r\n\r\nRuns consist of 3 or more cards in numerical order. The cards do not have to be the same colors. Joker cards can be used to complete runs.\r\n\r\nSets consist of two or more cards of the same number. Sets can include numbers from any color.   \r\n\r\nGame Play:\r\nPlayers draw a card from either the deck or the top of the discard pile at the beginning of their turn. At the end of their turn, they must discard a single card.\r\n\r\nCompleting phases:\r\nWhen you are able to fully meet the requirements of the phase, you may complete it. Additionally, you may play extra cards as you play the phase if they fit into the phase. For example, if you completed phase  '2 sets of 3' you could play three 4’s and three 6’s. You could play additional fours or sixes as part of your sets, but you could not add a different set.\r\n\r\nHitting:\r\nAfter making a phase, players may “hit” onto other phases in play. The cards you add to the completed phases must fit into the phase, and you can only hit after your own phase is in play.\r\n\r\nEnding the round:\r\nPlayers end the round by playing all of the cards from their hand. The player who goes out first wins the hand and scores zero points. The rest of the players score points (points are bad). Players who completed their phase move on to the next phase. Any players who were unable to complete their phase during the round must attempt to complete it again during the next round.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5K8PW","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Four In A Line V+","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1852.13510798887016446.01baa1b4-1663-4849-a4fe-e8bfa344c564.ef44bee0-90cb-4f96-bf92-af117fa0ecea","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5308.13510798887016446.cec581ba-166d-43d1-9da0-ef7794425c9e.ebf3d141-d345-4442-a351-9eac787dbffa","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8944.13510798887016446.51b3158a-8bfe-4cd1-b13a-d98f74e8dac1.3996b691-e2d6-4f11-8191-9557dd4f1081","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25189.13510798887016446.a5651d8f-f522-43d8-b62b-62d0421a6894.d70f8ea4-ae6a-4788-b934-d7057af07dae","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["ZingMagicLimited.FourInALineV_ekfg0vgp37mkp"],"ContentIds":["d7ff6ad5-5021-fe33-ca94-e3966a9c03b1","392b4998-0235-cae3-9a09-8bfe079a4787"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Welcome to the 2019 edition of Four In A Line.

This is done by surrounding it, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally (or a combination of all three). When this occurs, the opponent's discs that you have surround become yours. \r\n* If one player cannot make a valid move, the player must pass and the other player plays again. \r\n* The game is over when the entire board is filled or when no side can make a valid move. \r\n* The winner of the game is the one with the most discs when the game is over.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NR0QTPP13LG","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Coin Mania: Ninja Dozer","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60239.13763869398275449.f6b52ca2-d257-483e-aaa2-40db1112ca67.bc14aeb1-f8d2-4284-b020-9729fda0cdf7","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#7847F5","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58152.13763869398275449.67a88f2c-e8ac-4c4d-ba22-8a58f6b7094d.2a27b4a2-609f-46fb-b235-c8b55e892d7c","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#7847F5","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26173.13763869398275449.b8d4711b-4bb2-47a4-8ad7-b5e92f7fb288.9b301dc6-4613-4133-962e-d862dd411478","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#7847F5","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57479.13763869398275449.ea8082fc-5f94-493f-9f6d-ab8cdb5dc777.dd0cd396-eaa8-403e-a363-d492447cde7f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#7847F5","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["49037coindozercarnival.CoinManiaNinjaDozer_stpnvs9xw4swj"],"ContentIds":["78e0b159-d739-79f7-6d62-71b96ebe6ce4","efdbc793-25df-a286-83f4-7a3865b92ca1"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Coin Mania: Ninja Dozer is a traditional arcade game with new style - came to Tokyo!
