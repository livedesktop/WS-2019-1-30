Unforgettable adventures are waiting for you!\r\n\r\nYou are a young corsair, your aim is to become a pirate. To make your dream come true, you must find real treasures using old maps.\r\nThe game consists of different episodes. In each episode you have a treasure map. Follow it to the end and you will find the pirate's treasure.\r\nThe principle of this game is \"three in a row\", which means you have to switch two elements next to each other in order to get 3 or more similar gems in a row. At each level, you have a specific list of goals that need to be completed.\r\nIf you have any difficulties passing a level you can use coins to buy a helpful bonus. The coins are also used to restore lives and buy rum for the sailors in order to open new episodes.\r\nCollect treasures, compete with your friends and become a real pirate!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGGZMC4D","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Snowboard Party Lite","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8573.13510798883381455.5a485c19-0272-4516-a4c6-8c8580b0a864.217d9c9b-b4cd-477d-9f2b-0c6fdf7f6708","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60170.13510798883381455.ce3c877e-f8b0-4680-8b2b-296565887374.c2907c45-a299-4938-93be-da321d433e1f","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34735.13510798883381455.2a2935ae-6abb-4ddf-8624-91e193155a87.a96ba0fe-4f23-4151-82e4-d552baff0da1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57690.13510798883381455.89e8fd53-bf70-4fc7-bf6b-fede74217a1c.cc4b50e3-d407-455c-b8f5-6cbf3f4e0ced","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59680.13510798883381455.a36eeea1-7e1f-4219-a4fe-956e67de0bff.fc1b9d1d-9d50-4256-b722-07f18222c964","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43510.13510798883381455.9cc043c7-eb78-4544-a977-f7d9fc88c85b.07b8c95a-92d4-4e89-98b0-f09615c51221","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33335.13510798883381455.4ad418b1-7960-4a9f-8b98-fc0e4b3dee5f.b7ef3de2-9182-4a53-8033-fa2dfec0795d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.67.13510798883381455.980516f0-740c-4876-aa61-0e30905b4911.be88fd73-410d-4a6c-b00d-7532673e305f","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6525.13510798883381455.e6c9d8d6-a254-4709-b66b-7b84fe62aafa.5c2254b3-f519-4c16-bfe5-938f2cd0d8e3","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54660.13510798883381455.068bf038-068c-4e98-9631-3cb3defefa88.091bd83e-e2e4-4e9a-b360-ece348f20a5b","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["F223684A.SnowboardPartyLite_0ecc88g07fveg"],"ContentIds":["0ad62263-e992-3532-cfb5-3321e0fa27af","7023d138-f805-c3f5-dd44-7217aa76c188","1fc18c78-1acc-4d0d-e065-3e2bc9e66895"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Snowboard Party brings the thrill of snowboarding to your mobile device!

It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.\r\nDuring the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.\r\nDeveloping Chess strategy and improving your Chess skill!

Backgammon is a board game in which you move the pieces around the board according to dice rolls. Once you get all the pieces in the house you take them out according to your dice. The first player to get all the pieces out wins the game.\r\nDownload and play now!\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ challenging AI\r\n\r\n✓ auto bear off\r\n\r\n✓ easy to select and move pieces\r\n\r\n✓ fluid animations \r\n\r\n✓ HD graphics\r\n\r\n✓ detailed statistics\r\n\r\n✓ nice music and sound effects\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ TIPS ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ Your pieces are white and your opponent's pieces are black. There are 24 places on the board and two places to deposit the pieces. The 24 places are represented as triangles and called points. So the 1-point is the first place where pieces can stay. \r\n\r\n✓ The points from 1 to 6 are called the opponents’ home and the points from 19 to 24 are your home on the board. The opponent needs to bring all his pieces in the home region in order to take them out and so do you.\r\n\r\n✓ You can move around the board in one direction. You move from the bottom-right corner to the bottom-left corner then to the top-left corner and finally to the top-right corner on a path that resembles a horseshoe. The points from 1 to 24 follow this path in the same direction. Your opponent moves in the opposite direction following this path. \r\n\r\n✓ The game starts with a couple of dice rolls that decide which player should begin first. The opponent rolls first, then you. The one with the biggest pips’ count on the dice starts first. A pip is a dot on the face of a dice which counts as a point of movement or placement.\r\n\r\n✓ When your turn comes you start by rolling the dice and continue by making the moves.\r\n\r\n✓ If you roll a double your pips count will be twice the pips�� sum of the dice.\r\n\r\n✓ After you roll the dice some top pieces on your triangles, will be highlighted. You can start your move with any of those highlighted pieces. To move the pieces, you select the piece by tapping on the triangle on which it lies. Then, at that point the triangle turns blue and the places to which you can move next turn green. Tap on any of those green triangles to initiate the move. When the move ends and if there are moves left on the dice new pieces will be highlighted.\r\n\r\n✓ If one of your dice is one you can move one of your pieces only one position. If the piece lies on 2-point you can move it on 3-point for example. If you roll a double, you can make four moves with the same value of the dice from that roll.\r\n\r\n✓ You can move your pieces to columns occupied by your pieces, to empty places or places in which your opponent has one piece. \r\n\r\n✓ If you move your piece over the opponent's single piece you can capture it.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\n\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

You are automatically moved through a wonderfully designed little\r\nfantasy village that has 26 houses. Each house has a letter on the door and\r\nlots of little special effects floating around it. Just tap the door and the letter\r\nis pronounced in English.\r\n\r\nThen the game enters picture coloring mode where you can use fill and draw\r\ntools and have 16 colors to choose from. Each picture is related to an English\r\nword that starts with the letter on the door. The English word is also shown\r\nin outline form so each letter of the word can also be filled in and colored as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nOnce you are done coloring a picture you can return to the village where it\r\nwill congratulate you with one of several happy phrases and then you are\r\nautomatically moved through the village to the next house. When you get all\r\nthe way to the end and finish house \"Z\" it goes back to house \"A\" so you can\r\nstart again.\r\n\r\nThe app also saves your location so you start at the house where you left off.\r\nYou can always reset to house \"A\" from the pause menu where you can\r\nindividually turn the sounds and music on and off as well.\r\n\r\nThis app was designed in a way that makes young children to see the\r\nwonderful village so they will want to color more.
